# Student-Mental-Health-
 Analyzing Student Mental Health with Data
Mental health challenges are significant for international students adapting to new environments. In my recent project, I used PostgreSQL to analyze data from a Japanese university, exploring how social connectedness and acculturative stress impact depression levels.
# Analysis
The findings confirmed that international students face higher mental health risks, with length of stay playing a key role.
Observations:
 ðŸ“Œ Higher acculturative stress is linked to higher depression (e.g., 91 ASISS score at 5 years).
 ðŸ“Œ Social connectedness does not always improve with time (e.g., 32 SCS score at 10 years).
 ðŸ“Œ Longer stays may help reduce depression, but not acculturative stress.
